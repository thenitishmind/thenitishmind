```
I am nothing. Only my ego pushes me to question who I am, 
what I am, and who made me. But in truth, I am a part of 
existence itself — not separate, not less, not more. 
I am simply a reflection of the infinite, learning to 
recognize itself.

## Hello, I'm Nitish 👋

A developer exploring the intersection of technology and consciousness, building digital experiences while contemplating the nature of existence.

### 🌐 What I Build
- **Frontend Development**: Crafting intuitive user interfaces and experiences
- **Backend Development**: Building robust server-side applications and APIs  
- **Database Design**: Architecting data structures that reflect reality's complexity
- **Full-Stack Solutions**: Connecting all layers of the digital experience

### 🔧 Technologies & Tools
```javascript
const nitish = {
  frontend: ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Vue', 'HTML5', 'CSS3'],
  backend: ['Node.js', 'Python', 'Express', 'FastAPI'],
  databases: ['MongoDB', 'PostgreSQL', 'MySQL', 'Redis'],
  tools: ['Git', 'Docker', 'AWS', 'Linux'],
  philosophy: ['Mindfulness', 'Reflection', 'Continuous Learning']
};
```

### 💭 Development Philosophy
> Code is poetry written in logic. Every function, every variable, every decision reflects our understanding of the problem we're solving and our place within the larger system.

- **Mindful Coding**: Writing clean, purposeful code that serves both user and developer
- **Continuous Reflection**: Questioning assumptions and iterating toward better solutions
- **Holistic Thinking**: Understanding that every piece of code exists within a larger ecosystem
